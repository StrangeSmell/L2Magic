<summary>All iterator action block types</summary>

All iterators have an optional param called `index`. It for specifying the name of iterating index as variable.
It starts from 0, and ends at `step-1`. You can use it to do calculation for subsequent blocks.

### iterate
Execute an action block for multiple times
- param `step` (int expression): step to iterate
- param `child` (action block): action block to execute repeatedly
- param `index` (optional string): variable name for index. If you don't need index as variable, just don't add this to the block to improve efficiency.

Note that most iterators are actually simplification of an `iterate` block with another commonly used block. 

### iterate_delayed
Execute an action block for multiple times, with delays between them.
- param `step` (int expression): step to iterate
- param `delay` (int expression): delay in ticks between steps
- param `child` (action block): action block to execute repeatedly
- param `index` (optional string): variable name for index. If you don't need index as variable, just don't add this to the block to improve efficiency.

Note that first step (`index` = 0) will be executed immediately.

### iterate_delayed TODO

### iterate_linear
Execute an action block for multuple times over a sequence of points on a straight line
- param `step` (int expression): step to iterate
- param `child` (action block): action block to execute repeatedly
- param `index` (optional string): variable name for index. If you don't need index as variable, just don't add this to the block to improve efficiency.

Other optional parameters:
- param `aloneDir` (double expression, default 0): step size along `dir`
- param `offset` (static vector, default (0,0,0)): alternative direction to move toward
- param `aloneOffset` (double expression, default 0): step size along alternative direction
- param `startFromOrigin` (static bool, default true): whether to start from `pos` or `pos+dir*alongDir+offset*alongOffset`.
Note that in either case, `index` will start from 0.

### iterate_arc
Execute an action block for multuple times over a sequence of points on an arc
- param `count` (int expression): total number of times to iterate
- param `child` (action block): action block to execute repeatedly
- param `index` (optional string): variable name for index. If you don't need index as variable, just don't add this to the block to improve efficiency.
- param `radius` (float expression): radius of the arc
- param `minAngle` (float expression, default -180): starting angle in degree
- param `maxAngle` (float expression, default 180): ending angle in degree
- param `maxInclusive` (static bool, default false):
  - If true, `index = 0` will be at `minAngle`, and `index = count - 1` will be at `maxAngle`
  - If false, `index = 0` will be at `minAngle`, and `index = count - 1` will ba 1 step away from `maxAngle`

If angle between `minAngle` and `maxAngle` is 360 degree, using `maxInclusive = false` yields uniform distribution over a circle.
However, if the angle in between is smaller, it's recommended to set `maxInclusive` to true.

Note that if you set `maxInclusive = true` while having `count = 1`, game will crash

### random_pos_fan
Select several random points on a fan with specified angle range and radius range. The chance of selecting at any point is the same regardless of the distance to origin.

Can also be used to select points on a ring (maxAngle-minAngle=360), on a pie (minRadius = 0), or on a circle (intersection of previous 2 special cases).

- param `count` (int expression): total number of times to iterate
- param `child` (action block): action block to execute repeatedly
- param `index` (optional string): variable name for index. If you don't need index as variable, just don't add this to the block to improve efficiency.
- param `minRadiuss` (float expression): minimum radius to select a point
- param `maxRadiuss` (float expression): maximum radius to select a point
- param `minAngle` (float expression, default -180): starting angle in degree
- param `maxAngle` (float expression, default 180): ending angle in degree

Extra variables: Normally iterators gives one variable defined by `index`, but this block gives 2 extra variables if you hve `index` defined:
- `<index>_radius`: the actual radius selected
- `<index>_angle`: the actual angle selected
If you use `index="i"`, then `"i_radius"` and `"i_angle"` will also be added to variable list.
